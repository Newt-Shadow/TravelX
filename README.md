## 🌟 Key Features

* **Effortless Trip Recording:** Automatically detects and records your trips with high precision, using a sophisticated sensor-fusion algorithm. Also supports manual start/stop for full control.
* **Offline-First Sync:** Your trips are always saved locally first. The app intelligently syncs with the backend when an internet connection is available, ensuring no data is ever lost.
* **Peer-to-Peer Syncing with Bluetooth:** 🤝 In areas with no internet, TravelX can sync your trip data with nearby "Travel Buddies" using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), creating a mesh network for data transfer.
* **Intelligent Activity Detection:** Utilizes a combination of GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope data to accurately determine your mode of transport (walk, run, bike, car, bus, train).
* **Advanced Analytics & Insights:**
    * **Trip History:** A detailed log of all your past trips, with maps and statistics.
    * **Personalized Insights:** Understand your travel patterns with charts and graphs.
    * **Heatmaps:** Visualize your most frequented routes and destinations.
* **Travel Buddy Discovery:** Discover and connect with other TravelX users nearby, turning solo trips into social experiences.
* **Secure & Private:** User data is anonymized and securely handled.
